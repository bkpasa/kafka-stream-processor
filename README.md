# Kafka Streams Examples


This project contains code examples that demonstrate how to implement real-time applications and event-driven
microservices using the Streams API of [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) aka Kafka Streams.

This example shows how to use kafka as a storage. It illustrates creation of the materialized view and how to query this view.
